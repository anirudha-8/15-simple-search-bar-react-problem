Welcome to the **fifteenth problem** of the React 30+ Practical Problems series! In this challenge, we will build a search bar that dynamically filters a list of items based on user input.

### Problem 15: Search Bar with Filtering 🔍

Build a React application that allows users to search for items from a list and dynamically filter results as they type.

---

## 📝 Problem Description

Create a React search bar component with the following features:

- A **text input field** where users can type search queries.

- A **list of items** displayed dynamically based on the user's input.

- **Case-insensitive filtering** to match user input with list items.

- Display a message like `"No results found"` if no matches exist.

- Implement **optimized rendering** using `useState` and `useEffect`.
